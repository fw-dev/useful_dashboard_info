# FileWave Extra Metrics
The purpose of Extra Metrics is to augment a standard FileWave installation with additional metrics and dashboard capabilities. 

# Overview
Extra Metrics provides a series of dashboards and prometheus metrics related to how your fleets deployments are progressing.  The information can be used to show "at-a-glance" insights into the software patch status, device health and user specific deployments.  In as many cases as possible the Dashboard panels are linked into the FileWave Web in some way to provide a way to "drill down" into the information. 

Features:
* Example dashboards are included in this project; and will be installed automatically. 
* Configuration & validation is mostly automation via the extra-metrics-config command (run as sudo please)

# Requirements
Before you begin - it's very important to ensure that you meet the requirements for this additional module. 

Minimum FileWave system requirements: 
1. The Extra Metrics system runs only on the Linux version of FileWave (unless you configure it manually on Mac)
1. FileWave Version 14+: Extra Metrics requires version 14 or higher of the FileWave product.  It will fail to configure on anything less.
2. SSH: You will need SSH access to your FileWave Server.
3. Create an API Key specifically for this module (with inventory *create* rights).  You will require the base64 text, this can be obtained from the Manage Administrators -> Application tokens screen.
4. Make sure your server has SSL certificates - self signed certs are not enough. 
5. You must have an externally reachable DNS name.

# Installation
These instructions assume you will be installing Extra Metrics directly on your FileWave Server, which already has Python3.7 (or later) installed.

> We *highly* recommend installing Extra Metrics into its own python virtual environment.  Doing so ensures that the introduction of this module cannot interfere with the operational integrity of your FileWave Server.  

> DO NOT INSTALL EXTRA METRICS DIRECTLY INTO THE PYTHON RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT OF YOUR FILEWAVE SERVER.  

> If you are unsure about the above statement - STOP - contact your FileWave SE or support.  Your FileWave Server installation can be destroyed by mis-understanding the impact of this configuration.

## Installation Steps (requires SSH)
Assuming you are already logged into your FileWave Server using SSH, follow along to set up the virtual environment, install the Extra Metrics package and configure it for use. 

For the purpose of these instructions we are assuming a non-root user called gregor has been created.

    $ /usr/local/filewave/python/bin/pyvenv $HOME/extra-metrics
    $ source $HOME/extra-metrics/bin/activate

Your terminal prompt changes - the name of the virtual env should show up:

    (extra-metrics) $ pip install filewave-extra-metrics

At this stage the python package for Extra Metrics is installed but not configured; before completing configuration you need an API Key (and SSL certs)    

## Create & configure an Inventory API Key
Extra Metrics should be configured with an Inventory API Key in order to access Inventory and create the inventory groups and queries.  You will need the base64 text version of this API Key, which can be obtained from the Manage Administrators -> Application tokens dialog in the FileWave Administrator console.

> Please create a unique access token (API Key) for the Extra Metrics module

> Note: the extra-metrics-config command is created by installing the filewave-extra-metrics package; you will need the full path to this command if you are using sudo.

Once you have the API key; use the following commands to configure the server properly (you need to re-run this if the DNS name or API key changes). 

    $ export CONFIG_PATH=`which extra-metrics-config`
    $ export API_KEY='insert-your-api-key-here'
    # export DNS_NAME='dns-name-of-fw-server-here'
    $ sudo $CONFIG_PATH --api-key $API_KEY --external-dns-name $DNS_NAME

You will see output similar to the following, confirming that the dashboards have been imported, YAML files written and that the configuration was successful. 

```bash
[extra-metrics] [INFO] loading the configuration from file /usr/local/etc/filewave/extra_metrics.ini

```

## Upgrade the grafana-pie-chart plugin (for best results)
The pie chart plugin likely needs an update.  You can upgrade it to the latest version using the following command:

    $ grafana-cli --pluginsDir /usr/local/filewave/instrumentation_data/grafana/plugins plugins update grafana-piechart-panel

## Restarting Services
If this is the first time you have installed the Extra Metrics module; you will need to tell supervisord to reload its configuration and to start the extra_metrics job.

    $ /usr/local/filewave/python/bin/supervisorctl update

## Validating
> Note: it can take a few seconds (60 or so) for the metrics to be collected by prometheus and made available.  

When you view the list of dashboards available in Grafana, you'll see 3 new ones - each with a 'patching' tag, as shown below:

## Upgrading
To upgrade the Extra Metrics module; just run the install command again but include an '--upgrade' flag.  It is recommended to run the "config" portion of the setup
again to make sure that any configuration & dashboard panel changes have been applied as well and then restart services.

    $ pip install --upgrade filewave-extra-metrics
    $ sudo $CONFIG_PATH 
    $ /usr/local/filewave/python/bin/supervisorctl update
    # /usr/local/filewave/python/bin/supervisorctl restart extra_metrics

## Hint: don't skip this - SSL Certs
Make sure you have an SSL certificate, it must be valid, trusted by everyone (not just the server) and absolutely under no circumstances should it be self signed.  

Just do this - you'll save yourself untold pain.  Trust me I'm still healing.

# What information is exported by Extra Metrics?

## Software Patch Status
The software update (patch status) of clients is calculated using software  update catalogs as well as information delivered by clients about the updates they require. 

Panels provided:
- A birds eye view of the entire fleet's patch status - represented via percentage numbers of patch deployment, grouped by state (success, pending installation and warning/error).  
- Numbers related to (critical) updates that are not fully deployed. 
- Links into the FileWave web UI to make remediation or further investigation easier. 

## Device Health
The whole fleet of devices is continuously sending data back to the FileWave Inventory system which is used to calculate device health.  

Panels provided: 
- Device health summary - a grouping of all devices by health state.  The health of a device is calculated as follows: 
 - TBD (disk space, outstanding patches)

# Changelog

19-Jun-2020 (v32):
- new: configuration for the polling delay, default is 30m (but re-queries happen automatically on model update and query changes)
- new: work on making it possible to run this on a Mac server (experimental at this point)
- cleaned up links on the Patch Status dashboard and fixed the tags/links to other dashboards
- wrote unit tests to make sure that the dashboard JSON is correct before deploying it
- corrected install/pip requirements that were missing 

17-Jun-2020 (v29):
- experimental: re-runs app queries if any new query is updated, model update is run - this paves the way for reducing the number of polling requests being made, once more events are being sent from the FW server
- the app version dashboard now properly reflects the queries in the group 'Extra Metrics Queries - Apps', there is now one panel for each query.
- the app version dashboard now contains a quicklinks panel; allowing users to quickly get into the web UI for each of their app queries
- the server version check is now performed via a REST call instead of using local binaries and parsing that result
- changed to asyncio under the hood to allow for subscriptions to FW server events and removed dependancy on TimeLoop module
